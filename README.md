# Kt2Dart

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/38gy6t4offcp39jb?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ice1000/kt2dart)

This is a transpiler which consumes a subset of Kotlin and convert it into Dart.

Currently it's completely in progress. But it can do some simple jobs right now.

I will not add any support for **extension**, for it's too complex(it needs too much analyzing and this is a very simple tool).

# Why Kt2Dart

Because I want to **Make Flutter Great Again**. Dart is too weak, for the dynamic typing and no null safety. Kotlin is much more powerful. If we can combine the beautiful flutter and the powerful Kotlin, the world will become better.
